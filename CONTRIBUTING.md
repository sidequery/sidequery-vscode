### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Install dependencies**: `bun install`
3. **Make your changes**: 
   - Add tests if you've added code that should be tested
   - Update documentation if you've changed APIs
   - Ensure your code follows the existing style
4. **Run tests**: `bun test`
5. **Commit your changes**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages
6. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.0+
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) v1.74.0+
- [DuckDB CLI](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation) (must be in PATH)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sidequery-vscode.git
cd sidequery-vscode

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/sidequery-vscode.git

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run the extension in development mode
# Press F5 in VSCode to launch a new window with the extension loaded
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write meaningful commit messages
   - Keep commits focused and atomic
   - Add tests for new functionality

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   bun test
   
   # Run specific test suite
   bun run test:duckdb
   bun run test:arrow
   
   # Test the extension manually
   # Press F5 in VSCode to launch extension
   ```

4. **Update documentation**
   - Update README.md if needed
   - Add JSDoc comments to new functions
   - Update API documentation if you've changed public APIs

5. **Submit PR**
   - Push your branch to your fork
   - Create a pull request from your fork to the upstream main branch
   - Fill out the PR template completely

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let` when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add type annotations for function parameters and return types
- Use interfaces for object types

**Example:**
```typescript
interface QueryResult {
    success: boolean;
    data?: any[];
    error?: string;
}

async function executeQuery(sql: string, database: string): Promise<QueryResult> {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: camelCase (e.g., `sqlParser.ts`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `DuckDBExecutor`)
- **Functions/Methods**: camelCase (e.g., `parseStatements`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`)
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase with "I" prefix discouraged

### Comments and Documentation

- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use JSDoc for public APIs
- Keep comments up to date with code changes

**Example:**
```typescript
/**
 * Parses SQL content into individual statements
 * @param content - The SQL content to parse
 * @returns Array of SQL statements with position information
 */
export function parseStatements(content: string): SqlStatement[] {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Follow the existing test structure
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate

**Example:**
```typescript
await test('should parse multiple SQL statements', async () => {
    const sql = 'SELECT 1; SELECT 2;';
    const statements = parseStatements(sql);
    assert(statements.length === 2, 'Should have 2 statements');
});
```

### Test Organization

- Place integration tests in `test/integration/`
- Place unit tests alongside source files as `*.test.ts`
- Use fixtures for test data in `test/fixtures/`
